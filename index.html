            <h1>Welcome to valorant!</h1>
            <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.
                Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around
                the world.
                In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team
                having five players on it.
                Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that
                requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives.</p>

                        <h3>BRING IT // Premier Global Launch</h3>
                        <p>
                            Premier is a tournament game mode in VALORANT. Matches use the same in-game rules as
                            Competitive, but with a focus on top-tier competition and playing together as one squad
                            throughout a tournament structure, including additional features taken from pro play such as
                            map pick/ban phases.
                            At its highest level, it will serve as a direct connection from the playerbase to the
                            professional scene.

                        <p>
                            Gaia's Vengeance, one of the most popular collections introduced in Valorant, is making a
                            comeback. The latest news indicates that Gaia's Vengeance 2.0 is in the works and will make
                            its way into the popular shooter very soon.
                            The community feedback to the original skin bundle being highly positive has led to Riot
                            forging a new iteration that will cater to a few other weapons.

                        <h3>SUNSET // Official Map Trailer</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sunset is one of VALORANT's more traditional maps with two sites and three lanes. Its one
                            additional feature is a mechanical door found between B Market and Mid Courtyard.
                            Players can use a switch on the Market side of the door to close or open it. This door is
                            impenetrable while closed but has 500 HP, allowing players to damage and eventually destroy
                            it.
